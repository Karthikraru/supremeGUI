# Supreme Bot with a GUI
### A supreme autocheckout bot that purchases limited items for a user in less than 5 seconds! Make sure you look at the master branch as opposed to the main branch.
## Installation
```
pip install tkinter
git clone https://github.com/Karthikraru/supremeGUI.git
```
## Motivation
#### After months of being unable to purchase a pair of Supreme Air Force 1s for retail, I was fed up and decided to learn how to make my own bot. I started off with basic autofills until I learned how to more effectively web scrape and make the bot as efficient as possible. After lots of trial and error, I'm proud to say that I got my pair of Air Forces for retail!
## Build Status
#### The main automation portion of this bot is completed. I am looking to add google login with the new APIs and potentially proxy support in the future.
## Features
- Check out in under 5 seconds
- User friendly UI
- Pick a size of the item
- Pick a color of the item
